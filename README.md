Overview

#randomwalk
The Random Walk Simulation is a Python-based project that models the random motion of a point (often referred to as a "walker") in a two-dimensional space. The walker's movement is determined by random changes in direction and step size, resulting in a path that appears to "wander" across the screen. This project is an excellent way to visualize random processes and can be extended to include various features like obstacles, boundary conditions, and multiple walkers.

#circleGame
Circle Game is a simple Python-based game built using Pygame where players control a circle that moves around a screen, avoiding walls and eating food scattered across the playing field. The goal is to move around the arena, avoid collisions with walls, and collect as much food as possible.
